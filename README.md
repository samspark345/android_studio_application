# Deliverable2 Explanation 
Based on the marking scheme, we assume the functionalities that must be implemented for deliverable2 are: deleteService, addService, and editService. 
For deleteBranch and deleteCustomer accounts, we will implement them later into next stage. In order to implement deleteBranch, we need Branch as a class and implement relative functionality, which will be covered in next deliverable. Also, note that service requirements have not been implemented due to time constraints, and will be added later.
