# Deliverable2 Explanation 
Based on the marking scheme, we assume the functionalities that must be implemented are: deteleService, addService, and editService for deliverable2. 
For deleteBranch and deleteCustomer account, we will implemented later into next stage. In order to deleteBranch, we need Branch as class and implement relative functionality; it will be covered in next deliverable. Also, note service requirements have not been implemented due to time constraints, and will be added later.
